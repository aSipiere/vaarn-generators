  descriptions: {
    Entrance:
      "As you step down into the vault, you find yourself in an empty metal room, sand lines the edges of the room but the structure seems in good condition. From this room there are 4 barely lit hallways leading into other rooms in the vault.",

      "A derelict storage space. Boxes of maintenance supplies are everywhere, lights flickering and the smell of cleaning chemicals is everywhere.",
    "Biology Lab":
      "Containers with strangely shaped creatures in liquids are displayed prominently. Boards on the walls contain detailed scientific notes in a strange language.",
    Showers:
      "Grimy and unkempt, the showers are long since abandoned. Molds grow on the tiles and the scent of mildew hits your nostrils the moment you enter.",
    Kitchen:
      "Left unattended far too long, the kitchen is all but unusable. This room reeks of rotting food and mold.",
    "Medical Facility":
      "Beds for the infirm are in one corner, large sealed medicine cabinets line a wall, all smells sterile and clean",

      "6 bunk beds, enough to sleep 12 humanoids are present, several lockers are present next to these sleeping positions.",

      "Large computer banks line the walls of this room, a loud whirring of fans and other machinery is present throughout. The room smells sterile and dead",
    Armory:
      "Somewhat looted, this room has racks with various weaponry available on them",
    "Waste disposal":
      "Several disposal containers are here marked with symbols indicating the types of waste they should be used for. There's a faint stench in the room of rotting biological matter as well as sanitation supplies",
    "Water filtration and harvesting":
      "Moisture flows from unseen mechanisms above into containers where automated systems pump it through filtration systems",
    "An empty room":
      "Suspiciously clean and well kept, there is no obvious purpose or reason for this room.",
